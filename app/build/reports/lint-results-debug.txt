/home/a/AndroidStudioProjects/WaterSortAndroid_BuildReady/app/src/main/res/layout/activity_main.xml:2: Error: Class referenced in the layout file, androidx.constraintlayout.widget.ConstraintLayout, was not found in the project or the libraries [MissingClass]
<androidx.constraintlayout.widget.ConstraintLayout
^

   Explanation for issues of type "MissingClass":
   If a class is referenced in the manifest or in a layout file, it must also
   exist in the project (or in one of the libraries included by the project.
   This check helps uncover typos in registration names, or attempts to rename
   or move classes without updating the XML references properly.

/home/a/AndroidStudioProjects/WaterSortAndroid_BuildReady/app/src/main/res/values/styles.xml:3: Error: Style Theme.AppCompat.Light.NoActionBar should not extend itself [ResourceCycle]
    <style name="Theme.AppCompat.Light.NoActionBar" parent="Theme.AppCompat.Light.NoActionBar"/>
                                                    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "ResourceCycle":
   There should be no cycles in resource definitions as this can lead to
   runtime exceptions.

/home/a/AndroidStudioProjects/WaterSortAndroid_BuildReady/app/build.gradle:13: Warning: Not targeting the latest versions of Android; compatibility modes apply. Consider testing and updating this version. Consult the android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES javadoc for details. [OldTargetApi]
        targetSdk 34
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "OldTargetApi":
   When your application runs on a version of Android that is more recent than
   your targetSdkVersion specifies that it has been tested with, various
   compatibility modes kick in. This ensures that your application continues
   to work, but it may look out of place. For example, if the targetSdkVersion
   is less than 14, your app may get an option button in the UI.

   To fix this issue, set the targetSdkVersion to the highest available value.
   Then test your app to make sure everything works correctly. You may want to
   consult the compatibility notes to see what changes apply to each version
   you are adding support for:

/home/a/AndroidStudioProjects/WaterSortAndroid_BuildReady/app/build.gradle:20: Warning: A newer version of androidx.appcompat:appcompat than 1.6.1 is available: 1.7.1 [GradleDependency]
    implementation 'androidx.appcompat:appcompat:1.6.1'
                   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "GradleDependency":
   This detector looks for usages of libraries where the version you are using
   is not the current stable release. Using older versions is fine, and there
   are cases where you deliberately want to stick with an older version.
   However, you may simply not be aware that a more recent version is
   available, and that is what this lint check helps find.

/home/a/AndroidStudioProjects/WaterSortAndroid_BuildReady/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml:5: Warning: Should explicitly set android:icon, there is no default [MissingApplicationIcon]
    <application
     ~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "MissingApplicationIcon":
   You should set an icon for the application as whole because there is no
   default. This attribute must be set as a reference to a drawable resource
   containing the image (for example @drawable/icon).
